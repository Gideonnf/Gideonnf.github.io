                            <a class="text-info">Class Dismissed</a> is a first-person Horror Survival Game that I worked on with a team during my internship in Kajaani University of Applied Sciences or KAMK in short. 
                            We were tasked to make a commercial game in 7 weeks and this game was the result. It was developed in Unreal Engine and set in KAMK's Campus. You are playing as a student trying to get out of school 
                            but you are not alone. One of the lecturers is still doing a late night shift. Hide from her, find the items and escape. For this project, I was in-charge of the Gameplay Features such as the Player Movement, Inventory system, Items, Game Events 
                            and tutorial features.

                          <h2 class="text-right font-weight-bold" style="color:gold">About the Project</h2>
                          <p>
                              During my internship in KAMK, we were left to form our own groups with other exchange students. In my team, I was the only singaporean. I was grouped with two Thailand students, one finnish student and 
                              one Arabic student. The project was challenging for a few reaons. My team only had one 3D Artist and our game was very 3D Intensive. Another reason was that my team was new to game development. The other 
                              programmers were software developers and were new to game development. As such, I had to help a lot in the game design process as I was able to provide a lot of help on that part. It was also 
                              the reason why I took up most of the game play features.  
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Unreal engine was also challenging as we had no experience in it. I only had experience with Unity and OpenGL, so picking up the new game engine took a bit of time out of the development process. Fortunately, 
                              it was not that difficult as blue prints were easy enough to understand and learn. At the end of it, the biggest issue that I feel we had was communication due to language barriers. However, we managed to overcome 
                              these issues and produce a finished product at the end of the 7 weeks that I can be proud of.
