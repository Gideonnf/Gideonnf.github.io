                            <a class="text-info">SIDM Sorting Pot</a> is a Augmented Reality Game developed by a team, consisting of myself and Sophie Tan as my artist, for SIDM's Openhouse 2019.
                            Players are given a list of potions that represents the different aspects of SIDM. Such as "Math" and "Virtual Reality" or "3D Modeling" and "Drawing". The AR App will 
                            give the player courses that fits what they selected. It was developed to help us explain how our school courses work and to help visitors narrow down their choices in 
                            what courses they would be interested in.

                          <h2 class="text-right font-weight-bold" style="color:gold">About the Project</h2>
                          <p>
                              My club lecturer approached us to help in digitalizing our Openhouse games. Both me and Sophie were assigned to a team and had came up with this Sorting Pot idea. We felt that 
                              the mythical theme behind the game suits SIDM and our lecturers were also on board with the idea so we went to implementing it. This project was challenging for a couple of reasons. 
                              I was still relatively new to Unity and AR Development and the game only had 3 days to be finished. 
                              <br>
                              <br>
                              Fortunately, due to learning the basics in OpenGL, learning to use Unity was easy enough. AR Development in Unity 
                              had also been easier to pick up as they had built-in support for it. However, I still needed to crunch through three days to be able to finish the project in time for Openhouse. We managed 
                              to finish it in time and had received really good feedback on the Game. It had worked as intended and really helped visitors to find out more about our school and what courses they would be 
                              interested in.
